This is my attempt at creating a basic website! I built a personal portfolio webpage with a New Year Countdown Timer. It’s not perfect, but I’m really proud of what I’ve learned and created.

##Here’s what I included in the project:

1.New Year Countdown Timer:
A simple timer that counts down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until January 1, 2025. When the countdown ends, it shows a "Happy New Year!" message.

2.Feedback Form:
I added a form where people can share their feedback about my website. It includes fields for a name, email, a rating of the website, and any suggestions they might have.

3.About Me Section:
A small section where I introduced myself, shared a little about my skills, and added a picture of myself inside a circle.

4.Responsive Design:
I tried to make the website look good on both big and small screens (like phones and laptops) using CSS Media Queries.
